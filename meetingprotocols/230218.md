Questions:
- Algorithm in terms of Flink architecture or as general as possible?
- How detailed should the software architecture be described in the report?
- Deliverables for the code, Github Repo enough?

Evaluation:
- Time of an element in the stream, source -> sink
- Time distributions of different k and l and p (maybe not enough data)
- different levels of generalizations
-- use a fixed generalization for comparability
- varying number of quasi identifiers
- check distributions at different points of time compared to overall distribution of data set
- not sure yet about comparability to other studies?


Define a language to define the generalizations

look into windowassigners

generate data according to distribution in source

custom windowassigners according to Algorithm
