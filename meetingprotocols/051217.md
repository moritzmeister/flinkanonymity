# Meeting Protocol 05/12/2017

## Questions:
- Is the project about developing a new methodology or implementing an existing one for the case of Apache Flink?
- Adapt the methods from static data sets to data streams or is the theory for that already available?
- Data delivery? Data streamed from some data file, like .csv etc. or is there a real streaming source? Twitter etc. not suitable
- What would be an example of a use case of applying l-diversity to streamed data?
- Assumptions:
  - Can we assume that we only have to protect one sensitive attribute per table?
  - Can we assume that the sensitive column is categorical and not continuous?
