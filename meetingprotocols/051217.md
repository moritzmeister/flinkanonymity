# Meeting Protocol 05/12/2017

## Questions:
- Is the project about developing a new methodology or implementing an existing one for the case of Apache Flink?
  - Use Continuous Privacy preserving data publishing paper as baseline and go from there
- Adapt the methods from static data sets to data streams or is the theory for that already available?
  - Get Overview and come up with an idea to adapt the k-anonymity algoritym from the paper above
- Data delivery? Data streamed from some data file, like .csv etc. or is there a real streaming source? Twitter etc. not suitable
  - Use the same data as paper in order to have comparability
- Last Meeting Elisabetha said, first step should be to implement k-anonymity and l-diversity together, isn't every l-diverse set also k-anonymous?
- "The objective is to build a component in charge of executing the k-anonimity+l-diversity algorithm in a streaming context", which paper? Or develop new method/algorithm, does she mean adapt the one from the Continuous Privacy preserving data publishing paper?
- Do we make assumptions?
  - Can we assume that we only have to protect one sensitive attribute per table?
  - Can we assume that the sensitive column is categorical and not continuous?

### Deliverables:
- Software
- Report, as soon as the idea is clearer: what has been done
